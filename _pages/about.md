<!-- Introduction -->

<div class="col text-justify p-0">
  I am an Analog and Mixed Signal Design Engineer at Synopsys Inc., and I work on design of High Speed Mixed Signal Wireline Tranceivers. I have been awarded <span class="font-weight-bold">First Class with Distinction</span> for my <i>Bachelor in Technology</i> degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Delhi Technological University(formerly, Delhi College of Engineering). I have been the recepient of <span class="font-weight-bold">Shastri Research Student Fellowship</span>, awarded to only 12 most promising undergradute researchers in India every year by Shastri Indo-Canadian Institute, MHRD India. As a Shastri Research Fellow, I have worked at Polystim Neurotechnologies Lab, Polytechnique Montreal, in the area of Brain Machine Interfaces during the summer of 2017. I have also worked at VLSI Design Tools and Tehnologies Lab, at IIT Delhi as a Junior Research Fellow during the fall semester of my senior year, in the area of Low Power Analog Design. During my Junior year, I was also a part of Digital System Architecture and Design(DSAD) Research Group at Delhi Technological University.
  <p>
  <p>My goal is to push the capabilities of the next generation communication and computing systems to the boundaries of theoretical limits.   

  research interests lie the design, and development of next generation analog communication and computing systems. Ultra high speed wireline and wireless transceivers, low power mixed signal circuits come under the umbrella of next generation communication systems, while neuromorphic chips, and brain inspired analog computing, comes under the umbrella of next generation computing systems.

  I am a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.ml.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Machine Learning Department</a> of the <a href="https://www.scs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">School of Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. My advisor is <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/" target="_blank">Tom Mitchell</a> and I work on <a href="http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/rtw/" target="_blank">Never-Ending Learning</a>.

  My current research is motivated by the fact that real-world problems require integrating multiple, distinct modalities of information (e.g., image, audio, language, etc.) in ways that machine learning models cannot currently handle well. Most deep learning approaches are not able to utilize information learned from solving one problem to directly help in solving another. They are also not capable of <span class="font-weight-bold">never-ending learning</span>, failing on problems that are dynamic, ever-changing, and not fixed a priori, which is true of problems in the real world due to the dynamicity of nature. With my research, I aim to bridge the gap between UTCs, deep learning, and never-ending learning, by proposing <span class="font-weight-bold">neural cognitive architectures (NCAs)</span> that are inspired by human cognition and that can learn to continuously solve multiple problems that can grow in number over time, across multiple distinct perception and action modalities, and from multiple noisy sources of supervision combined with self-supervision. Their experience from learning to solve past problems can also be leveraged to learn to solve future ones. If you are interested to read more about NCAs, my <a href="{{ '/assets/pdf/thesis/proposal.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}" target="_blank">thesis proposal</a> would be a good place to start. Throughout my PhD I have also worked on <a href="{{ '/projects/' | prepend: site.url }}">multiple other projects</a> related to artificial intelligence and machine learning.

  Before I joined CMU, I graduated with an M.Eng. in <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering" target="_blank">Electrical and Electronic Engineering</a> from <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Imperial College London</a>. For my Master's thesis I proposed a way to use topic modelling methods in order to perform human motion classification.
