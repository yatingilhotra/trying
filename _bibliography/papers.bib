  abstract      = {In this paper, we describe the design of adaptive exponential(AdEx) integrate and fire neuron model using log domain state-space synthesis. We emphasize on the implementation of mathematical models of membrane charge-discharge process, commonly occurring in biological neurons using translinear principle, because of inherent ability of the approach to scale the currents down to arbitrarily low values, which results in extremely low power implementations. We describe the techniques used to achieve lower currents representing the exact same dynamics of distinct neuron membranes, and we also analyze the translinear topologies supporting the use of such current reduction techniques. In the end, we implement two variable AdEx model using the described topologies.}

  booktitle     = {Writting. To be submitted to IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems},
  abstract      = {This  paper  presents  an  architecture  implementing Smoothed-Teager Energy Operator(TEO) based action-potential detector  to  be  used  in  concoction  with  a  multielectrode  array aimed at efficiently detecting extracellular neural recordings. This article first improves on an already established approach of setting the threshold adaptively based on Robust Statistics concepts, by significantly reducing the algorithm's area and run-time requirements. The  efficacy  of  the  approach is  validated  using  synthetic  neural  signals  derived  from  real extracellular neural recordings. The approach is juxtaposed against prevailing state-of-the-art spike detection methods and is shown to outperform them through MATLAB simulations. The digital hardware realizing the approach is then designed in Verilog HDL which occupies 0.04 square-millimetre of area, and draws 87uW of power when mapped to 65nm CMOS technology}

Topologies for Half-Wave Rectifiers (HWR), and Full-Wave Rectifiers (FWR) working in both positive and negative rectification modes are proposed. The variation of the voltage transfer curves (VTC) with change in the bias voltage, and the ability to set the gain by reworking the resistor values are included. The functional verification of proposed circuits is carried out using Cadence Virtuoso tool using SCL's 180nm technology. Effect of process corner and temperature variations was also studied, and it is observed that the circuits are resilient.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, an FPGA-based single precision floating point hybrid iterative architecture for solving a linear system of equations is proposed. The novel architecture implements Gauss-Seidel method using a Jacobi method based building block. The design takes advantage of the fast convergence of Gauss-Seidel Method conflated with parallel, pipelined architecture of Jacobi Iterative solver resulting in a much efficient architecture with acceptable hardware augmentation. The whole design has been implemented in Verilog HDL, having Virtex 7 XCV2000T as targeted device. Other design optimizations include using modified high-speed radix 4 multiplier and optimized high-speed 2's complementer. The efficacy of the design is tested and implemented in solving nonsingular, exactly determined and strictly diagonally dominant coefficient matrix based dense and sparse linear system of equations with different number of variables. The design results in reduced number of iterations and equivalent speedups are presented, which are calculated factoring in, the increased delay effects.},
